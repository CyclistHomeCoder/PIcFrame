# PIcFrame

Hobby project to create a simple Photo Frame using a Raspberry Pi.

Uses the pi3d (http://pi3d.github.io/) project and is heavily based on the PictureFrame app from https://github.com/pi3d/pi3d_demos. The goal is to create a lightweight and easy to install Picture Frame package for a Raspberry Pi.

Installation instructions will come here.
